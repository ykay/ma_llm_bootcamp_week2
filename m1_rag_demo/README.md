# Overview
The Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a basic LlamaIndex workflow

1. Data ingestion (loading)
2. Indexing and storing
3. Querying

# Setup
1. Create an `.env` file with `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
2. Feel free to put any supported data files (e.g., PDF, image, word doc) into the `data/` folder and set the query string to anything you'd like to ask regarding the ingested data.
